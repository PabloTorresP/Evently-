# EVENTLY-
We are a group of students at IE University who are creating some algorithms that help you filter through the events in a .csv and give you recommendations.

#  **DATASET**-
The dataset presents relevant information about 52 concerts in Madrid, making it a valuable resource for individuals seeking for a concert based on their interests and taste.The data set contains various concerts in genres such as Pop, Techno, Rock, R&B, Flamenco, Trap, Reggaeton, Urbano, Jazz, Blues, and Rap, including Alternative. It encompasses various variables, including:
  Artist specifications
  Date of the concert
  Concert time
  Latitude and longitude coordinates for the concert location (for mapping)
  Venue name
  Energy scale
  Genre
  Price
The dataset has been manually created by the group.

#  **Functionalities**-
Our platform has two main functions:
Concert Search:
Users can search for concerts based on various criteria, including artist name, maximum time, genre, and maximum price.
The search results are displayed, and users have the option to return to the main menu or exit.

Concert Recommendation:
Users can use the recommender system to find concerts based on specified preferences such as date, time, genre, energy level, and price.
The top 5 recommended concerts are displayed, and users can choose to return to the main menu or exit.

#  *External Libraries*-
The project relies on several external libraries:

- pygsheets: Used for working with Google Sheets.
- pandas: Used for data manipulation with DataFrames.
- datetime: Used for working with date and time.
- heapq: Used for implementing the heap data structure.
- PySimpleGUI: Used for creating a simple GUI for user interaction.
